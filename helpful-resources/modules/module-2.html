  * In a file called letterlocator.c write a program that prompts the user for an alphabetic character,

  * Your program should work for both capital and lowercase letters, but should reject any input that is not alphabetical, like '3' or '$'.
  *
  * Example:
  * $ ./letterlocator
  * Give me a letter: A
  * A is at position 0
  * $ ./letterlocator
  * Give me a letter: e
  * e is at position 5
  * $ ./letterlocator
  * Give me a letter: @
  * Give me a letter: Y
  * Y is at position 25

  * (Hint: cs50 Library functions GetChar() and isAlpha() will be helpful)

<h3 id="class-2-studio-crazy-echoes">Class 2 Studio: Crazy Echoes</h3>
<p>This studio will be made up of 2 separate programs, (<code>backwardsecho.c</code> and <code>mixedupecho.c</code>) The instructions for both programs are included here. You will start with the first program <code>backwardsecho.c</code> and follow the directions for the other program.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight"> /**
  * Filename: backwardsecho.c
  * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module2/studios/backwardsecho
  * 
  * PART 1: Backwards Echo
  * In a file called backwardsecho.c write a program that accepts some command-line arguments, 
  * and then simply "echoes" those arguments back to the console, similar to the Module 2 Prep for Class 2 walkthrough argv-1
  * The twist: each string should print out backwards.
  *
  * Example:
  * $ ./backwardsecho hello 64
  * ohcesdrawkcab/. olleh 46
  *
  * Notice that the order of the arguments should remain unchanged, i.e.
  *      "./backwards-echo" prints first, followed by "hello", followed by "46". 
  * But when it comes time to print the string, you should print its characters in reverse order.
  *
  */</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight"> /**
  * PART 2: Mixed-up Echo
  * Filename: mixedupecho.c
  * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module2/studios/mixedupecho
  *
  * Now for another variation on the "echo" theme. In a file called mixedupecho.c
  * write another program that accepts some command-line arguments and then echoes them back to the console.
  *
  * The twist this time: the echoes should "intermix" with each other, like so:
  * $ ./mixedupecho HELLO!
  * .H/EmLiLxOe!dHuEpLeLcOh!oH
  *
  * For this program, you can ignore any command-line arguments beyond the first two (including the program name itself):
  * $ ./mixedupecho HELLO! morestuff lalala
  * .H/EmLiLxOe!dHuEpLeLcOh!oH
  *
  * Notice how "HELLO!" is shorter than "./mixedupecho", and so the program "wraps around" 
  * and starts over again at 'H'whenever it reaches the end of the string.
  *
  * How can you implement that? The modulo % operator is your friend here.
  * Spcecifically, note that "HELLO!"[5] yields '!', and "HELLO!"[6] is beyond the bounds of the array.
  * But "HELLO!"[6 % 6] evaluates to "HELLO!"[0], which yields 'H'.
  * And "HELLO!"[7 % 6] evaluates to "HELLO!"[1] ...
  *
  * To keep things simple, you can assume that the second argument will always be shorter than the first. 
  * In other words, the user will never provide a string longer than "./mixedupecho", which is 13 characters long. 
  *
  * **Bonus (Optional)**
  *
  * Just kidding about that last part.
  *
  * Now you may NOT assume the second argument will be the shorter one. 
  *
  * Example: The user might type this:
  * $ ./mixedupecho GREENEGGSANDSPAM
  *
  * in which case the output should be:
  * .G/RmEiExNeEdGuGpSeAcNhDoS.P/AeM
  *
