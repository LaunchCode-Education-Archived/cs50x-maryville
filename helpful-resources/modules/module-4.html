<h3 id="class-x-studio-word-grid-stretch">Class X Studio: Word Grid Stretch</h3>
<p>You will only submit 1 file, <code>wordgridstretch.c</code>, but there are formatted instructions to create <code>stretchvertical.c</code> and <code>stretchhorizontal.c</code> to help you to complete the Studio.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight"> /**
  * Filename: wordgridstretch.c

  *
  * The word grid is back with a vengence!
  *
  * Just like last week, this studio involves taking some strings from the user, and then printing them back out in a transformed way.
  *
  * Today, your program will apply a "stretch" factor to the grid of letters, making it larger.
  * 
  * It is easiest to explain via example. The finished program should behave like this:
  * 
  * $ ./wordgridstretch goat crab bear
  * Your word grid currently looks like this:
  * goat
  * crab
  * bear
  * Now I will stretch it out. How much should I stretch by?
  * 3
  * After stretching by 3, you now have this!
  * gggoooaaattt
  * gggoooaaattt
  * gggoooaaattt
  * cccrrraaabbb
  * cccrrraaabbb
  * cccrrraaabbb
  * bbbeeeaaarrr
  * bbbeeeaaarrr
  * bbbeeeaaarrr
  * That's what we mean by "making the grid larger".
  * 
  * Validation
  * 
  * Don't forget to validate the user's input. Specifically, you'll want to ensure:
  * 
  *   1. that the user gave you exactly 3 words as command-line arguments
  *   2. that those words are all the same length
  *   3. that the user provides a non-negative stretch factor
  *  
  * Submitting
  * 
  * You don't have to submit stretchvertical.c and stretchhorizontal.c. You only have to submit wordgridstretch.c.

<p>Break it Down</p>
<p>To get started, we suggest you try two simpler versions first, <code>stretchvertical.c</code> and <code>stretchhorizontal.c</code>.</p>
<p>A program that just stretches the grid vertically:</p>

  * 3
  * After stretching by 3, you now have this!
  * goat
  * goat
  * goat
  * crab
  * crab
  * crab
  * bear
  * bear
  * bear
  *
  */</code></pre>
<p>A program that just stretches the grid horizontally:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight"> /**
  * $ ./stretchhorizontal goat crab bear
  * Your word grid currently looks like this:
  * goat
  * crab
  * bear
  * Now I will stretch it out horizontally. How much should I stretch by?
  * 3
  * After stretching by 3, you now have this!
  * gggoooaaattt
  * cccrrraaabbb
  * bbbeeeaaarrr
  * Only after writing these little badboys should you start to think about how to combine both steps into one big badderboy.
