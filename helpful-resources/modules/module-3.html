<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">/**
  * Filename: wordgrid.c
  * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module3/studios/wordgrid
  * 
  * Recall that you can represent multi-dimensional data with nested arrays. 
  * For example, you can represent a grid of things as an array of (arrays of things).
  * In fact, an array of strings is one such example; since a string is actually just an array of chars, 
  * an array of strings is an array of (arrays of chars).
  * Let's explore this by writing a program that receives three 3-character strings (in other words a grid of 9 chars),
  * and prints the grid to the console, with each word in its own column, like so:
  * 
  * Example:
  * $ ./wordgrid sun yes ear
  * sye
  * uea
  * nsr
  * 
  * Notice how each word is written downwards, rather than across.
  * 
  * First you'll want to perform some validation:
  * Make sure the user provided exactly 3 additional command-line arguments 
  * (in addition to the name of the program itself).
  * Make sure each of those arguments is exactly 3 characters-long. (Use strlen())
  * After validating, you can go about printing the grid.
  * 
  * Note that you can access the elements of a nested array using multiple brackets, i.e. [][]. 
  * For example, if words looks like:
  * 
  * [ "sun", "yes", "ear" ]
  * , then:
  *
  * words[0][0] evaluates to "sun"[0] which evaluates to 's'
  * words[2][1] evaluates to "ear"[1] which evaluates to 'a'

<h3 id="class-2-studio-multiplication-and-exponents">Class 2 Studio: Multiplication and Exponents</h3>
<p>This Studio will consist of 4 separate files that will all be saved in one folder called <code>multiplication_and_exponents</code> in the <code>workspace/module3/studios</code> directory.  You can cd into this directory and then use the command <code>mkdir multiplication_and_exponents</code>. </p>
<p>If you decide to copy parts of these instructions to place into each file, please remember that comments follow this structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">// Single line comment
/*
 Multi-line comments
 Make sure you end the comment block correctly. (If you do not all of your code will be blue!) 
*/
int main(void)</code></pre>
<p>This studio is broken into 4 parts, which can be copied to the top of your file so that you can complete each part.   </p>
<ul>
<li>PART 1: You will copy the <a href="../../calendar/cs50/unit1-fundamentals/module3/materials/studios/multiplication-exponent/Makefile.html">Makefile</a> from the Studio and save it in <code>~/workspace/module3/studios/multiplication_and_exponents</code>.  </li>
<li>PART 2: You will save in a file called <code>mult.h</code> (for the function prototype). </li>
<li>PART 3: You will save in a file called <code>mult.c</code> (for the function implementation) </li>
<li>PART 4: You will save in a file called <code>expt.c</code>.  The starter code is provided in PART 4 *<em>(there are no asterisks `</em>` preceding the code that will be copied to the file)** or you can copy it from <a href="../../calendar/cs50/unit1-fundamentals/module3/materials/studios/multiplication-exponent/expt.html">here</a>.  If you need help please ask! :smile:  </li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">/**
 * PART 2:
 * File: mult.h
 * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module3/studios/multiplication_and_exponents
 * 
 * Your next task should be to create those missing files. Let's start with `mult.h`. 
 * This is the header file for the multiplication function, and should 
 * include the function prototype. A prototype defines what a function uses for its inputs and 
 * outputs, but does not define what the function does. It is used to tell other parts of your 
 * program what kinds of functions are available for use. To keep things simple, our multiplication 
 * function will focus on integers. 
 *
 * Our function should take two integers as input and return an integer as output. This should 
 * be enough information to construct your prototype.
 * Believe it or not, the header file is now complete! It may seem silly to have only a single line of code in the 
 * header file, but for this example it is sufficient. More complex programs will require more complex header 
 * files, but this is fine for now.
 *
 */</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">/**
 * PART 3:
 * File: mult.c
 * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module3/studios/multiplication_and_exponents
 * 
 * Let's move on to mult.c. This file should contain the entire multiplication function. Fortunately you have already 
 * written the function definition - that's what the prototype is! Go ahead and copy it into the mult.c file.
 * 
 * All that's left now is to write the function body - how do we want our multiplication function to behave? 
 * It would be easy to use the multiplication operator (*) and call it a day, but we're going to give you some 
 * restrictions to make this a little bit more challenging. Specifically, you are not allowed to use the multiplication operator. 
 * You should perform multiplication using repeated addition instead. Also, you should accomplish this using recursion. 
 * That means loops are not allowed for this studio. Your multiplication function should be able to handle both positive 
 * and negative integers. To make things easier, focus on only positive integers first. Once you are satisfied that 
 * multiplication works for positive values, see if you can tweak your code to make it work with negative values as well. 
 * 
 * As always, it is important to test your code. It may be a good idea to write a simple main method in mult.c that 
 * you can use to test your mult function. (If you do add a main function to your mult.c file you can simply use the 
 * commands make mult and ./mult to compile and run your program, or else you will get a multiple definition of 'main' error.)

<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">/**
 * 
 * PART 4:
 * File: expt.c
 * Save in Folder: ~/workspace/module3/studios/multiplication_and_exponents
 * 
 * Copy the text below in a file called expt.c
 * 
     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

     //TODO: Write a recursive function that computes exponents.
     //This function will rely upon your multiplication function, so you should do that first!
     int expt(int x, int y) {
         //Your code here
     }

    int main() {
        //Test multiplication:
        printf("2 * 2 = %i", mult(2, 2));
        printf("3 * 9 = %i", mult(3, 9));
        printf("-3 * 9 = %i", mult(-3, 9));
        printf("3 * -9 = %i", mult(3, -9));
        printf("-3 * -9 = %i", mult(-3, -9));

        //Test exponentiation:
        printf("2^8 = %i", expt(2, 8)); //should be 256
        printf("2^3 = %i", expt(2, 3)); //should be 8
        printf("(-2)^3 = %i", expt(-2, 3)); //should be -8
    }
 * 
 * Once you are satisfied with your multiplication function, it is time to 
 * turn our attention to exponentiation. Exponentiation can be thought of as repeated multiplication, much like 
 * multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition. Like with the mult function, however, you are faced with 
 * some restrictions. The multiplication operator is still not allowed. Instead you should use the recursive mult 
 * function that you wrote. In order to do this, we need to tell the exponentiation function what the multiplication 
 * function looks like. We can do this by referring to the header file that we created.
 * 
 * Header files are referenced with the #include statement. So to include our header file in expt.c, we would type 
 *   #include "mult.c" 
 * 
 * Go ahead and add this to the expt.c file now.
 * 
 * You are now ready to use your multiplication function to compute exponents. Your solution should be recursive, 
 * so loops are still not allowed. Make sure to use your mult function to perform multiplication! Anywhere that 
 * you would normally use * should be replaced with a function call to mult.
 *
 * You should now be able to use make to run the provided test cases and check your work. Notice that for expt, 
 * the base (the first number) can be negative, but the exponent (the second number) cannot.
