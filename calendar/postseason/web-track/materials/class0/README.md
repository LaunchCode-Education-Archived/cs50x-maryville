Before coming to class today please complete [Class 0 Prep](../class0-prep).

### During Class

Today is mostly just a set-up day. We will do a walkthrough demo of the entire Studio from start to finish. The Studio will involve registering for a key with the API we'll be using, as well as diving right into the deep end of using Git on the command line.

* Studio: [FlickList 0](../studios/flicklist-0)
