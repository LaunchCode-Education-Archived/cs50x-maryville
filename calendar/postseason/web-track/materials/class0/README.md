# Class 0

Before coming to class today please complete [Class 0 Prep](../class0-prep).

### During Class

Today is mostly just a set-up day. We will do a walkthrough demo of everything you need to do to complete the Studio. This will involve registering for a key with the API we'll be using, as well as doing a little bit of heavy-duty Git on the command line.

* Studio: [FlickList 0](../studios/flicklist-0)
