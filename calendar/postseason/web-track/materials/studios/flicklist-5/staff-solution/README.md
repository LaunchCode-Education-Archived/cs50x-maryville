# Studio Solution: FlickList 1

The goal of this exercise is to make sure you are familar and comfortable with our staff solution to the previous studio, because when you work on the upcoming studio, you will be more-or-less starting where our solution left off.

With that in mind, it will be useful for you to go through our solution and "follow along", copying our implementation into your own IDE. 

### Assignment

Open up the terminal in your IDE, and navigate to your `/flicklist` directory:

```nohighlight
$ cd ~/workspace/web-track/studios/flicklist
```

Checkout a new branch called `studio1-followalong` off of `upstream/studio1`:

```nohighlight
$ git checkout -b studio1-followalong upstream/studio1
Branch studio1-followalong set up to track remote branch studio1 from upstream.
Switched to a new branch 'studio1-followalong'
```

Our solution to this studio can be found here:
https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/flicklist/tree/studio1-staff-solution

Your job now is just to literally copy our solution into your source code. 

Don't type the whole thing at once. Implement one little piece at a time and test the code to see what changes. As you go, make a note of any pieces of our solution that you don't understand.

Keep going until you've completed the whole studio.
