# Studio: FlickList 1

In [the previous Studio](../flicklist-0), you forked the project repository and added your API key to the javascript file. When the page loaded, our script sent an AJAX request to themoviedb.org, and a few seconds later, received a response containing a bunch of javascript objects dsecribing popular movies, which were logged to the console. You poked through this array of movie objects to answer a quiz question when submitting your assignment.

Today, you're going to get started adding some real functionality to the code base. By the end of this studio, users will see a browseable list of movies on the screen. Each movie will have a "Add to Watchlist" button, which, when clicked, will cause that movie to show up on another area of the screen where the user's Watchlist is displayed.
