<h1 id="studio-flicklist-1">Studio: FlickList 1</h1>
<p>In <a href="../flicklist-0">the previous Studio</a>, you forked the project repository and added your API key to the javascript file. When the page loaded, our script sent an AJAX request to themoviedb.org, and a few seconds later, received a response containing a bunch of javascript objects dsecribing popular movies, which were logged to the console. You poked through this array of movie objects to answer a quiz question when submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Today, you're going to get started adding some real functionality to the code base. By the end of this studio, users will see a browseable list of movies on the screen. Each movie will have a &quot;Add to Watchlist&quot; button, which, when clicked, will cause that movie to show up on another area of the screen where the user's Watchlist is displayed.</p>

<p>Here is what you are trying to accomplish: <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/flicklist/blob/ba335b0509258c7e4dc51779f9baa536f914c07b/index.html" target="_blank">FlickList 1 Demo</a>. Take a minute to play around with the demo so you understand what your goal is.</p>
<h3 id="more-about-branches">More about Branches</h3>
<h3 id="starter-code">Starter Code</h3>
<p>Navigate to the proper directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ cd ~/workspace/web-track/studios/flicklist</code></pre>
<p>Your git status should be clean of any unstaged changes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git status
On branch studio0-my-work
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
<p>(We are assuming you will still be on the <code>studio0-my-work</code> branch from last time. But if you're on a different branch, that's fine, as long as you see &quot;nothing to commit, working directory clean&quot;. If you do have unstaged or uncommitted changes, commit them now. If you need guidance, see <a href="../flicklist-0#how-to-submit">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Now let's fetch the <code>studio1</code> branch from the upstream repo:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git fetch upstream/studio1
From https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/flicklist
 * branch            studio1    -&gt; FETCH_HEAD</code></pre>
<p>and then switch to a new local branch with the contents of </p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git checkout -b studio1 upstream/studio1
Branch studio1 set up to track remote branch studio1 from upstream.
Switched to a new branch 'studio1'</code></pre>
<p>(Just an aside: The <code>-b</code> flag allows you to create and switch to a branch in one line. It's just a fancier version of this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git branch studio1 upstream/studio1
Branch studio1 set up to track remote branch studio1 from upstream.
$ git checkout studio1
Switched to a new branch 'studio1'</code></pre>
<p>You can use whichever you feel more comfortable with.)</p>
<h3 id="a-brief-tour">A Brief Tour</h3>
<p>Welcome to the studio1 branch!</p>
<p>Your folder structure should look the same as last time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ tree
.
├── index.html
└── js
    └── flicklist.js

1 directory, 2 files</code></pre>
<p>But the contents of those files is a little different. Let's take a look. Open up <code>index.html</code> and <code>flicklist.js</code> in your IDE.</p>
<h5 id="indexhtml">index.html</h5>
<p>The beginning of this file is more or less the same as last time. The only change is that we've added is this line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"/&gt;</code></pre>
<p>which explicitly defines that our document should use the Unicode character encoding. (If curious, you can read more about character encoding <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding" target="_blank">here</a>). Generally try to remember to add this line in your HTML, or you might get some strange results when your page attempts to display obscure characters. But for now, don't waste a ton of brainpower worrying about this topic.</p>
<p>The body of the document now has three main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> to display the project title and tagline</li>
<li>a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to display the movies that are on the user's watchlist</li>
<li>a TODO, where you will implement another <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, this one to display a browsable list of popular movies</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags might look unfamiliar to you. They are relatively new additions to HTML. They serve a similar role as the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>: a container for other tags, so you can group your document into chunks. The difference is that a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> does not indicate <em>what kind of content</em> it contains, whereas these new tags do: the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> indicates that it is meant to serve as a title or heading above some other content; the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> indicates a discrete section of your document. Using these tags instead of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s makes it more immediately obvious how your document is structured and what role the various chunks are playing. As much as possible, it is generally best practice to make your HTML &quot;semantically meaningful&quot; like this. You will learn a bit more about &quot;Semantic HTML&quot; in later Prep Work.</p>
<h5 id="flicklistjs">flicklist.js</h5>
<p>Let's now talk about what's changed in<code>flicklist.js</code>. </p>
<p>The beginning of the file still contains that <code>api</code> object, one of whose properties, <code>token</code>, currently has a value of <code>"TODO"</code>, which you should yet again replace with your personal api key.</p>
<p>There is another object nearby, called <code>model</code>. This is where we will store all the data we need to keep track of. You can see that this object has two properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>watchlistItems</code>, an array (initially empty) that represents all the movies on the user's watchlist</li>
<li><code>browseItems</code>, an array (also initally empty) that holds all the movies we want to make available to the user for browsing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving down the page, the <code>discoverMovies()</code> function is very similar to the function called <code>testTheAPI()</code> from last time: it makes an AJAX request to TheMovieDB's API, and after receiving a response, logs it to the console. But there is now a little bit more code inside that <code>success</code> function. </p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, there is a TODO! We want you to write a line here such that, whenever a response comes back from the API, you update the <code>model</code> variable so that its <code>.browseList</code> property is equal to the list of movies in the response.</li>
<li>After updating the model, we invoke a function called <code>callback()</code>. Where did that function come from? It turns out it was passed into us as an argument to <code>discoverMovies()</code>. The idea of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)" target="_blank">callback</a> is that whoever is invoking <code>discoverMovies()</code> can decide what should happen after the response comes back from the API. </li>
</ul>
