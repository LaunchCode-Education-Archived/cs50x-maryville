# Exercise: Robotic Interaction

Your task for this exercise is to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to allow users to interact with your robots. The design is largely up to you, but be sure to take advantage of the following helpful resources:

* A lot of the functionality can be reused from the [Robot I/O](../robot-io) exercise.
* [Doug's video] goes over the basics of creating GUIs in Eclipse
* These [design principles](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/) are invaluable

Once you are finished, be sure to test your GUI as much as possible.
