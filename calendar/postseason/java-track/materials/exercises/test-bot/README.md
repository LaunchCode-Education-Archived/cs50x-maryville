# Exercise: Test Bot 2000

In the [previous exercise](../its-alive) you designed and implemented a `Robot` class. We had you write some simple code to test your implementation, but now that we know about unit tests, it would be best to design a test suite for our `Robot`.

Your task for this exercise is to write more tests for your `Robot`. There should be at least one test for each method in the class.

As you proceed through future exercises you should re-run these tests to make sure they still pass, and add new tests for any additional features that you add.
