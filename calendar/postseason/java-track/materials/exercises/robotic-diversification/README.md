# Exercise: Robotic Diversification

Robots are typically designed with a purpose in mind, and their functionality is often times limited specifically to that purpose. For example, some Robots are made to [control spaceships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwBmPiOmEGQ), some robots are made to [bend things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fZdfXJmN6E), and some robots are made to [attack other robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBkEMZg1iqQ).

Your task for this exercise is to design some specific versions of robots. You may choose whatever kind of robot you wish, however here are some suggestions:

* Robots that push other robots
* Robots that attack other robots
* Robots that carry objects

Pick at least two different types of robots and develop classes for them. These new classes *should inherit from the `Robot` base class*. For each of these robots, consider:

* What behaviors do they have in common with other robots?
* What behaviors are different from other robots?

The different behavior should go in the new classes (called *sub-classes*) and the common behavior should be in the old `Robot` class (call the *base class*).

Note that you may need to modify the base class to get the sub-classes to work properly - designs are constantly changing!

Once you are finished, be sure to develop some unit tests for any new functionality that you have implemented.
