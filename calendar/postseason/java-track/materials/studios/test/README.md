##### Java Track

[Back to Class 2](../../class2)


# Studio: This is only a test.

In the [previous studio](../studios/class-design) you were tasked with designing a few Java objects.

Your task for this studio is simple: design unit tests for these objects. You should create at least one unit test for each method in your classes.

You can use the tests provided in [this walkthrough](https://youtu.be/2OftyGm6C7Y) as a template for your tests.

## Submission

Once you have written your tests (and they all pass!) submit them in three files: **RectangleTester.java**, **FractionTester.java**, and **BaseballPlayerTester.java**.
