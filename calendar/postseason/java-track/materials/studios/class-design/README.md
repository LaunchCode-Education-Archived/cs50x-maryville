# Studio: Class Design

This studio is an exercise in design. This means you will need to think creatively - there is no one "right" solution to these problems, but the choices you make will have an impact on how efficient and easy to use your solution is.

For each problem below, you are presented with a story. Based on this story, you should design an object in the form of a class. Be sure to consider the **has-a** relationship and the **behaviors** for each object you design.

We are not in a rush to implement these objects. Good design takes time. It will help to work out your design before you write code, using paper and pencil if necessary.

## Design Problems

### Rectangle

A rectangle has a length and a width. A rectangle should be able to provide its area and perimeter. A rectangle can indicate whether it is smaller than another rectangle in terms of area. A rectnagle can indicate whether it is in fact a square.

### Fraction

A fraction has a numerator and denominator. A faction should be able to add itself to another fraction, returning a new fraction that represents the sum. A fraction should be able to multiply itself by another fraction, returning a new fraction as the product. A fraction should be able to take the reciprocal of itself, returning that value as a new fraction. A fraction should be able to simplify itself, returning a new fraction as that simplification.

### BaseballPlayer

A baseball player has a name and a jersey number. Most players hit either right or left, but some can hit either way. This object should be able to react when a player completes a game, recording how many hits and RBIs the player earned in that game. A player has a certain number of runs and RBIs he or she has recorded over all games played. A player has a certain number of games he or she has played.

## Implementation

Once you have come up with a design for the object, you should implement it. Use your design to help you decide which fields and methods need to be created. Create some simple tests to make sure you implementation behaves as you expect it to.

## Submission

Once you are satisfied with your design and implementation, submit three files on vocareum: **Rectangle.java**, **Fraction.java**, and **BaseballPlayer.java**.
