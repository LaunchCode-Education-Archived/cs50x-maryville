<h1 id="exercise-census">Exercise: Census</h1>
<p>In a file called <a href="./census-0.html">census-0.c</a>, we have written a program that acts (sort of) like a government census taker. It basically just prompts the user for some basic info, and then echoes that info back to the console:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ ./census-0
Hello, thank you for signing up for: The United States
I'll need to get some info from you please...

First name (must be at least 2 characters long):
Henry
Last name (must be at least one 2 characters long):
Thoreau
State of residence (must be at least 2 characters long):
Massachusetts
Email address (must be at least 2 characters long):
hdt@transcendentalists.org

Great thanks, lemme just enter that into my system here...
Henry Thoreau from Massachusetts, at hdt@transcendentalists.org
Excellent! Please pay your taxes in April, or you'll be hearing from us (check your spam folder).</code></pre>
<p>The program also performs some (very weak) validation on the user input. It will continually re-prompt for a given field until receiving a response that is at least 2 characters long:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">...
State of residence (must be at least 2 characters long):
M
State of residence (must be at least 2 characters long):
x
State of residence (must be at least 2 characters long):
jabberwocky
Email address (must be at least 2 characters long):
...</code></pre>
<p>If you look at the source-code for <a href="./census-0.html">census-0.c</a>, you might notice that it is <strong>very</strong> repetitive. For each &quot;field&quot;, we have more or less the same code doing the same thing again and again:</p>
<ul>
<li>prompt the user for their info</li>
<li>call <code>GetString()</code></li>
<li>check whether their response was valid</li>
<li>continually re-prompt until the response is valid</li>
</ul>
<p>As you might guess, we did a bunch of copy-pasting, and in fact, all that copy-pasting led to a bug on line 22! We accidentally prompt for &quot;First name&quot; again, even though, by that point, we are supposed to be asking for the user's last name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">22. printf("First name (must be at least one 2 characters long):\n");
23. lastname = GetString();</code></pre>
<p>The repetitiveness also makes it harder to maintain. Let's say we changed our minds about the validation step, and wanted to require all strings to be 8 characters long, instead of 2. We would have to go in and manually change every single <code>2</code> to an <code>8</code>. Very annoying.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity to make our code more eloquent! That's where you come in. Instead of repeating the same code block 4 times, let's use a function. </p>
<p>In <a href="./census-1.html">census-1.c</a>, we have provided a function called <code>promptAndValidate</code> with the following signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">string promptAndValidate(string fieldname);</code></pre>
<p>This function accepts a string representing the name of the &quot;field&quot; you care about, e.g. &quot;State of residence&quot; or whatever, and then does all the work of prompting the user, validating their input, and returning the result.</p>
<p>All that's left to do is replace all those repetitive code blocks with some one-liners, making our function do all the work. </p>
