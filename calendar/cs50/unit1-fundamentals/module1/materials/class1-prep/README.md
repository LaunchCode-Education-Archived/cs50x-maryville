This introduces you to the environment where we'll be writing code throughout the course. <br>Stop at the *Writing Code* header. 
Do | Exercise | [Logging into the IDE](../exercises/ide) | This exercise contains instructions on how get started using the CS50 IDE, where you'll write all your code. Follow those instructions so you can start coding!
Do | Exercise | [Organizing Your Workspace](../../../../../../helpful-resources/CS50-IDE/file-management-resource.html) | In Helpful Resources, we outline how you should structure the folders in your workspace inside the IDE, and we walk you through how to create those folders.
Do | Exercise | [Hello](../exercises/hello) | Now that you've got your IDE set up, let's code! This exercise will walk you through writing a *Hello, World* program.
Watch | Doug's Playlist | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poT5Yd0Ag8I&list=PLhQjrBD2T38117CFyiIB9x4NOR6979YwA&index=1" target="_blank">Command-Line</a> | Watch the video from Doug's Playlist called *Command-Line*. This will introduce you to, you guessed it, the command-line! <br> There are cheatsheets in Helpful Resources for Terminal Commands<a href="../../../../../../helpful-resources/Supplementary-Resources/terminal-commands.html" target="_blank"> here</a> and one for Command Line Shortcuts <a href="../../../../../../helpful-resources/Supplementary-Resources/command-line-shortcuts.html" target="_blank">here</a> that contain topics from the video and more!
Watch | Section | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpSLlIj97Ss" target="_blank">Week 1 / IDE</a> | Watch the first ~13 minutes where they demo using the IDE, running some linux commands in the terminal, and writing a *Hello, World* program. <br> Stop at the 13:15 minute mark.

Follow-Along | Walkthrough | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQnyxpf0vk0" target="_blank">Hello-0</a> | Watch this video in which David Malan writes a *Hello, World* program. As you watch, follow along by creating your own copy of the same program in your IDE. Afterwards, try poking around and tinkering with your program: Change something, re-run, break it, fix it. <br> *If you want to challenge yourself, before watching the video, you can grab the psuedocode from <a href="../../../../../../helpful-resources/modules/module-1.html#class-1-task-hello-0" target="_blank"> here</a> to start writing the program in the CS50 IDE, follow the instructions and then watch the video to finish writing the program.
Do | Exercise | [Haiku](../exercises/haiku) | Do this simple *Haiku* exercise in your IDE. This should be similar to what you just did with David Malan (remember how to make a new line?).

Follow-Along | Walkthrough | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfb73qVXgn8" target="_blank">Hello-1</a> | Follow along (and type along in your IDE!) with David Malan as he adds some complexity to the *Hello, World* program. Use a variable to say hello to yourself! <br> *If you want to challenge yourself, before watching the video, you can grab the psuedocode from <a href="../../../../../../helpful-resources/modules/module-1.html#class-1-task-hello-1" target="_blank"> here</a> to start writing code in the CS50 IDE, follow the instructions and then watch the video to finish writing the program
Follow-Along | Walkthrough | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpEyhtpVHes" target="_blank">Hello-2</a> | Continue to follow along as David adds another wrinkle to this program: taking input from the user. <br> *The psuedocode for this Follow-Along is <a href="../../../../../../helpful-resources/modules/module-1.html#class-1-task-hello-2" target="_blank"> here</a>.
Do | Exercise | [Book](../exercises/book) | Do the *Book* exercise in your IDE. Remember how you got input from the user in the last Follow-Along.
