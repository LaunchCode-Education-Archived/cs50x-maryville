Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/1/f/notes1f/notes1f.html#conditions" target="_blank">Conditions</a> | Read the lecture notes about conditions, optionally rewatch this portion of the lecture. <br> Stop when you get to the *Loops* header.

Follow-Along | Walkthrough | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MUZL3kiPKI&list=PLhQjrBD2T383fi16gN97XlrTwdxDq2QWZ&index=3" target="_blank">conditions-1</a> | Build off your previous program, following David to add in a `else if` branch. <br> Grab the pseudocode to start writing the program <a href="../../../../../../helpful-resources/modules/module-1.html#class-2-task-conditions-1" target="_blank">here</a>.
Do | Exercise | [Age Restrictions](../exercises/age-restrictions) | Try the *Age Restriction* exercise to practice using conditionals. 
Watch | Doug's Playlist | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FC-8QaaYgs&list=PLhQjrBD2T38117CFyiIB9x4NOR6979YwA&index=3" target="_blank">Operators</a> | Watch Doug's video about operators. There's a fair amount of text on the screen, so you may want to take notes if you find that helpful. <br> You can also check out the Operators section of the C Language cheat sheet in the Helpful Resources <a href="../../../../../../helpful-resources/Supplementary-Resources/c-language.html#operators" target="_blank">here</a>.
Do | Exercise | [Decade](../exercises/decade) | Try the *Decade* exercise, where you'll need to fix program that has a bug. As a reminder, a bug is an error or flaw in a computer program that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result. 
Watch | Short | <a href="https://youtu.be/M058skV1iL0?list=PLhQjrBD2T381NKQHUCTezeyCYzbnN4GjC" target="_blank">Boolean Values</a> | Watch this short that reviews boolean values. Vipul writes notes on the screen, so feel free to write your own notes.

##### Loops:
Task | Resource Type | Link | Instructions
-----|---------------|------|-------------
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/1/f/notes1f/notes1f.html#loops" target="_blank">Week 1, continued / Loops</a> | Read the lecture notes on loops to get an introduction to for loops, and optionally rewatch the video. <br> Stop at the *Integer Overflow* header.
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/1/f/notes1f/notes1f.html#loops_continued" target="_blank">Week 1, continued / Loops, continued</a> | Read another section on loops, this time talking about while loops. <br> Stop at the *Variables* header. 
Watch | Short | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHmiHx7GGLE" target="_blank">Loops</a> | Watch this short about Loops. As a heads up, at the 5:34 mark you will see a program that has `main` method whose argument is different than void. You can ignore this for now; we'll come back to it later in the course. <br> Check out the C Language cheat sheet in the Helpful Resources <a href="../../../../../../helpful-resources/Supplementary-Resources/c-language.html#loops" target="_blank">here</a> when you're done for a recap.
Follow-Along | Walkthrough | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CHoS1xZMIk" target="_blank">Positive</a> | Follow along with David to create a program using a do-while loop. Also take note of when he talks about scope near the end of the video.   <br> Grab the pseudocode to start writing the program <a href="../../../../../../helpful-resources/modules/module-1.html#class-2-task-positive" target="_blank">here</a>.
Do | Exercise | [Validate](../exercises/validate) | Do the *Validate* exercise to practice using a do-while loop. You'll use the modulo operator to make sure the user is giving you an even number.

Read | Resource | [For vs While](../resources/for-vs-while/forvswhile.md) | Here we briefly illustrate how `for` loops and `while` loops truly are just different syntaxes for accomplishing the same thing.
Do | Exercise | [Countdown](../exercises/countdown) | Try the *Countdown* exercise for more practice with loops.
