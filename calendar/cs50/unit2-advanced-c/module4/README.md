# Module 4

**Pre-reqs:** You should have completed [Module 3](../../unit1-fundamentals/module3)

#### Synopsis 

Module 4 introduces a number of important topics:

* **pointers and memory management**: Here we will peel back the curtain on how data is stored in the computer's memory. We will learn new syntax for moving back and forth between a normal value stored in a variable, and a *pointer* to the memory address where that value is stored.
* **file i/o** allows you interact with saved files on the computer. I/O stands for in/out: you will learn both how to read in data from a file, and write out new data to a file.
* **structs** are a way of creating new data types. So far we've seen "primitive" types like `int`, `float` and `char`, as well as larger collection types like `array`. With structs, you can represent more complex custom types by combining these primitives together into clusters.

In Problem Set 4, you will combine your new skills in these topics to write programs that manipulate image files. You will literally be digging into the raw bytes of these images to rewrite their pixels.
