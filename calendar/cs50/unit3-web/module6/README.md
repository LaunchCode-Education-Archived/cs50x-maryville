# Module 6

**Pre-reqs:** You should have completed [Module 3](../../unit1-fundamentals/module3)

### Synopsis 

In this Module, we tearfully say farewell to our beloved C, and move to the exciting world of web programming. *The Internet*. What is it? Is it really just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes" target="_blank">series of tubes</a>? We're about to find out. 

We'll learn about the protocols that allow users to connect with servers, and get our first taste of languages (HTML and CSS) used in web development. By the end of this Module, you will be able to create (relatively) pretty web pages, and do some interesting things by communicating with servers.
