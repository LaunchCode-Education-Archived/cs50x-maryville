# Resource: SQL Tutorial

Let's get you some practice writing SQL queries.

For this, we are going to send you out to the website codecademy.com, which provides a nice, interactive user interface where you can learn and type in one window.

### Make an Account

If you don't already have an account on codecademy, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/register" target="_blank">register here</a>.

### Get Started
Once you have an account, do these two lessons:
* <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-sql/lessons/manipulation/exercises/sql" target="_blank">Manipulation</a>
* <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-sql/lessons/queries/exercises/queries" target="_blank">Queries</a>

These should take about 10 minutes each.
