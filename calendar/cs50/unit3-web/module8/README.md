# Module 8

**Prereqs**: You should have completed [Module 7](../module7)

### Synopsis

The last Module of CS50! In Module 8 we turn our attention to the "front-end", where a new language, JavaScript, will allow us to run code directly in the user's browser. This enables us to dynamically inspect and modify the contents of the HTML the user is seeing. We will perform this interaction by way of something called the Document Object Model (the DOM), a JavaScript "object" representation of the HTML document. 

We will also make heavy use of jQuery, a popular JavaScript library (kind of like cs50.h) that makes DOM manipulations, and many other JavaScript tasks, easier and more powerful. Finally, we will see a new technique for communicating with servers, called AJAX, via which we can request and receive data from an external source without ever leaving or refreshing the current page. 

In Problem Set 8 you will combine all these new skills (and more PHP) to create an interactive display of data from both Google's Maps API and Google's News API.
