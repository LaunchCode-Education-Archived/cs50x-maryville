# Exercise : Codecademy / jQuery

Once again, it's time to take a field trip over to Codecademy to get your hands dirty writing some code, this time to learn jQuery!

Do the following three lessons:
* <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/web-beginner-en-bay3D/resume?curriculum_id=50a3fad8c7a770b5fd0007a1">Introduction to jQuery</a> (13 exercises)
* <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/web-beginner-en-GfjC6/resume?curriculum_id=50a3fad8c7a770b5fd0007a1">Functions and Selectors</a> (13 exercises)
* <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/web-beginner-en-v6phg/resume?curriculum_id=50a3fad8c7a770b5fd0007a1">Modifying HTML Elements</a> (14 exercises)

This should take you 3 - 4 hours overall. If you have spent more than that, feel free to take a break from this and move on to the rest of the Class 2 Prep Work.
