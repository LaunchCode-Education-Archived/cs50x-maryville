# Problem Set: Pset 8

### Synopsis

For this problem set, you will create a website that overlays local news headlines on top of a searchable, draggable map of the United States.

This is what you will ultimately build: https://mashup.cs50.net

This project touches on pretty much every facet of web development we have learned in Module 6, 7 and 8. Your website will have:
* an interactive front end using JavaScript along with jQuery and a few other JavaScript libraries, using AJAX to receive data from...
* a back end, written in PHP, providing data sourced from both a SQL database and two Google APIs

The assignment is called Mashup, because it involves "mashing together" a large number of third-party services, taking advantage of code that other people have already written, so that your work is less about doing one thing in depth, and more about wiring all the services together in a cohesive way.

### How to submit 

In the IDE, right-click on your `pset8/` folder, and choose "Download" to download a compressed version of the file (a `.tar` or `.tat.gz`) to your local machine.

In Vocareum, click on the assignment titled **Problem Set 8: Mashup**.

Upload your "tar ball" and click Submit!

### Guidance

You are provided with a large code-base to start off. Try to resist the urge to rush directly into your TODOs, and take some time to get a good understanding of how all the different pieces of this project are working together. The projects you will do "out in the real world" are going to be equally big or bigger, so it is important start to get a sense for how to structure these large apps in a managable way. It is also important to gain the skill of being able to read someone else's code and understand vageuly what it is doing -- this is something you will do all the time as a professional developer.
