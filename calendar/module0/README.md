# Module 0

### Synopsis
Module 0 is meant to introduce you to CS50x, and to give you the foundation you'll need before you start programming. You'll meet David Malan, the Harvard professor for this class, and some of the teaching fellows (or TFs) from Harvard. They will introduce binary numbers and algorithms, important concepts you'll need to understand in order to think like a computer programmer. By the end of the module, you will be familiar with pseudocode, and a graphical language called Scratch, which you'll use to complete Problem Set 0. 

Before coming to the first day of class, aka [Class 0](materials/class0/), you should complete *all* of [Class 0 Prep](materials/class0-prep). If you finish this with time to spare, and are itching to do more, we've included a few more resources that we encourage you to check out before the class begins.

So without further ado, let the learning begin!
