##### Module 0
[Back to Prep for Class 0](../class0-prep#scratch)

### Introduction

Welcome to your first problem set of CS50x! These Problem Set pages will help guide you through the Problem Set for each Module. As you will see, Harvard provides their own specifications for each Problem Set (for convenience, we'll call these "Pset Specs"). However, this can be confusing for students, since Harvard's Pset Specs can be _very_ long, and make reference to some policies at Harvard that won't be applicable to you. 

We'll use this Problem Set 0 page to help you understand the Harvard Pset Specs. After this, we'll assume it's old news to you, but you can always refer back to this page if you get confused about what you need to pay attention to, and what you can ignore. 

### Pset Spec Overview

Here is the Spec for Pset0: <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/0/pset0/pset0.html#itching_to_program" target="_blank">Problem Set 0: Scratch</a>. Go glance at it for a sec, then come back.

At the top of every Pset Spec, there is a brief description of the "Objectives" for that Problem Set. Feel free to read these over if you want, but it is not essential that you do. 

The next section is about "Academic Honesty". We have a slightly different policy than Harvard; you can read about our policy in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E72HS409WnV_Ss6VNfzbX9WSYjOqKIJ1d_QtdZpb9xI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Student Guide</a>. If you're interested, you can read Harvard's policy for their students, but in general you can ignore this section.

Likewise, the next section on "Assessment" is only relevant to Harvard's grading structure. Ours will be different. This is also discussed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E72HS409WnV_Ss6VNfzbX9WSYjOqKIJ1d_QtdZpb9xI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Student Guide</a>. If you have questions about grading for a specific Problem Set, ask your course instructor and/or teaching fellows. 

After all that, you get to the meat of the Problem Set. However, this section can still be confusing. This section will vary from Problem Set to Problem Set, but here are some general guidelines:
* There will usually be a number of videos embedded in the page that are relevant to the Problem Set. You will likely have already seen these during the Prep Work for that Module. You can optionally rewatch those videos. Occassionally there will be videos not included in the Prep Work, in which case we recommend watching them (as long as you find them helpful).
* Most Problem Sets will have multiple components. We will include links in these Problem Set pages to each component, and make sure you know what you need to submit.

#### How To Submit
The last section of every Pset Spec is "How To Submit". **Please ignore this section!** For this class, you will be submitting your assignments on Vocareum. You should have received an invitation to join Vocareum as a student user; instructions for how to use Vocareum are included in your <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E72HS409WnV_Ss6VNfzbX9WSYjOqKIJ1d_QtdZpb9xI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Student Guide</a>. For each Problem Set, you will find instructions on Vocareum of how to properly submit your assignment (we will also include those instructions in each Problem Set page). 

In addition to submitting on Vocareum, you can also optionally choose to submit your assignments on edX. To do that, login to edX and follow the instructions in the Pset Specs in your Courseware CS50x dashboard there. If you submit all your assignments on edX, you'll receive a certificate from them. It's not too much extra work to do that, and you may find it cool to get that certificate, and in that case we encourage you to submit your assignments there. But, it is important to note that *we only require to submit your assignments on Vocareum*.

#Problem Set 0

Phew, that was long. But now that you know all that, we won't have to do that again. 

### Synopsis
For Problem Set 0, your mission is to build a project in Scratch. Scratch is a graphical programming language developed by MIT. Through this, you will be able to implement some basic programming concepts in an easy and intuitive way. 

### Guidance
You will have already seen most of the videos, but we recommend watching Zamyla's video called "Scratch" (especially for those who are less comfortable).

If you're interested, you can review some of what learned about binary and ASCII by watching the videos in this section: <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/0/pset0/pset0.html#1001000_1001001" target="_blank">1001000 1001001</a>. This is optional, but you may enjoy the refresher. 

### Components
The only component for this Problem Set is to build your Scratch project. You can find the project requirements on the Pset Spec here: <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/0/pset0/pset0.html#itching_to_program" target="_blank">Problem Set 0: Scratch</a>

### How To Submit

FILE NAME: pset0.txt

INSTRUCTIONS: Once you have completed your Scratch project, copy the URL (web page address) of your game, and submit it on Vocareum as a "txt" file. To do this, log in to your Vocareum account (you should have received your login credentials in an email), find the assignment on the left labeled "Problem Set 0: Scratch", and *carefully* follow the instructions there. On Vocareum you will see more specific instructions on how to submit your project. Remember to submit your assignment before coming to the first day of class!

NOTE: Make sure you get the file name correct: "pset0.txt". If you use a different name, our auto-grader will not find it and you will not receive credit!

### Congratulations! 
You're done with CS50x's first problem set, and are almost ready for the first day of class. Return to [Prep for Class 0](../class0-prep#scratch) to finish the Prep Work and see what else you can do while you wait for class to start.
